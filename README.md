# Visual-Inertial SLAM Simulation Platform

The entire project is build on [OKVIS: Open Keyframe-based Visual-Inertial SLAM](https://github.com/ethz-asl/okvis).

In addition to simplifying the implementation, I will add different SLAM backend algorithms for completeness.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
cmake --build .
./okvis_test
```
